# Timetable for the setup of e15507

### Outstanding questions
- [ ] When will Greg move his stuff out of S2?
- [ ] Need a beamline -> iso 100 adapter to couple chamber
- [ ] Can we borrow the hornet by this Friday 5/17?
- [ ] When can we borrow the Masytecs from Thomas?
- [ ] Is there someone who can be in charge of the electronics?
  - The DAQ config is already written and the control of HV for IC and MCP is solved downstream
- [ ] When will we get the HPGe? Sometime around 6/13 or 14?
