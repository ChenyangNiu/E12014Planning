# Questions to answer
1. Vacuum table, Pump. (Hi Adam, I remember you told me these two things in someoneâ€™s hand, could you please check these 2 things is usable.)
2. Frame can hold the vacuum table and rise-fall. ( Seam told me it finished, but maybe have some problem. )
3. When vacuum table hold the anode board, how to make sure the anode board can get through the dowel pin( this part needs to practice without epoxy. )
4. 1mm spacer is enough for the 200Mohm resister and read out cable. ( we need solder the cable and resister on the prototype, then check. )
5. Enough conductive epoxy, and the conductivity.
6. Small weight need to be added on the cable to make the cable straight. Does the vacuum table can hold this extra weight. ( practice with vacuum table )
7. Proper quantity of epoxy, when the transparent board arrived, we can practice.
