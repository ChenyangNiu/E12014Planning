## System specifications
* Always maintain a positive pressure in the ion chmaber (IC)
* Control pumping speed using one valve
* Control venting speed using one valve
* GHS should use absolute pressure monometer during run
* GHS should use differential pressure gauge during venting/pumping
* We should always be at vacuum when the TPC is
