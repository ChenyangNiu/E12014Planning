Voltages are defined at top and bottom plate (GND and +HV).

Anode and cathode board are connected to potentials through conductive epoxy and platted through hole dowel pins.

The thrid point of common referece is the Frish Grid. The potential is passed around the outside via SMD connections on the window and side pieces.

To actually supply the voltage to the Frish Grid, It is passed through the side wall. This involves a distortion of the field, but should be minimized by the location of the Frish Grid and it has 1.5 cm to heal before there is any place with beam. This voltage will be used to pass off to the small shaping board.

The small shaping board will be grounded to the shim (and by extention the top plate) through dowel pins and conductive expoxy.
